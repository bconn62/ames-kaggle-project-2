# ames-kaggle-project-2
ames housing prices


This is project #2 of the GA data science immersive course, focusing on analyzing the well known Ames, Iowa housing dataset. The purpose of this project was to utilize linear regression to try to predict the prices of a holdout set, as well as familiarize ourselves with online machine learning competitions such as Kaggle. 


Prompt: "You are tasked with creating a regression model based on the Ames Housing Dataset. This model will predict the price of a house at sale. The Ames Housing Dataset is an exceptionally detailed and robust dataset with over 70 columns of different features relating to houses. Secondly, we are hosting a competition on Kaggle to give you the opportunity to practice the following skills:
refining models over time; use of train-test split, cross-validation, and data with unknown values for the target to simulate the modeling process; the use of Kaggle as a place to practice data science."
